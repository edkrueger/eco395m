Hello! My name is Yundi Xiao. I am interested in microeconomics, especially in applied microeconomics and behavioral economics.
Programming and data are fun to work with and are such powerful tools. And python is an important programming language in both academia and industry. Thus, I am taking this course to learn more about python.
