Hi, I am Yundi Xiao. I am interested in the microeconomics, espeically in behavioral economics and applied microeconomics. 
Programming and data are fun to work with and are such powerful tools. And python is an important programming language in both academia and industry. Thus, I am taking python to learn more.
