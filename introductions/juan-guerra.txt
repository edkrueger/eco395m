Hello y'all!

	My name is Juan Guerra and I am on my second semester of the 10-month track Econ MA program. My interest in Economics stems from my experience as an immigrant
and trying to understand the choices made by my family when they chose to emigrate to the US. In this journey I have become particularly interested in behavioral
economics, finance, and monetary policy. I do not have much formal training in data analysis and programming so I am looking forward to gaining an understanding of
the practical applications of programming to economic analysis. 

	In my free time I enjoy traveling to many places both with the US and to other countries. I also enjoy music, hiking, and finding new and exciting ways to
experience life. I am looking forward to learning with you all!
