Hi, my name is Ruiqi Sun. 
Iâ€™m passionate about economics, with a particular interest in industrial organization and the study of incentives - how people and firms respond to different environments. 
I also enjoy programming because it makes it much easier to handle and analyze data, which deepens our understanding of economic questions. 
Outside of academics, I like to play basketball and play video games in my free time.
