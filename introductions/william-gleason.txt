Hello my name is William Gleason. I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics here at UT Austin and 
I wasn't ready to leave so soon. My favorite topics in Economics are microtheory and public econ. 
I have very little coding knowledge outside of R but I wanted to challenge myself by taking this course.
I am looking forward to improving my technical skills through this course.
