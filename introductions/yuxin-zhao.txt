Hi, I am Connie. Since my undergraduate studies in economics, I have always had a strong interest in the subject. During my undergraduate years, I assisted Professor Zhou at the University of International Business and Economics on research related to green finance. Through this experience, I developed skills in organizing and analyzing data.

I also interned at CITIC Securities and IDC China, working as a research assistant in equity research and data analysis. These internships allowed me to apply data analysis skills in real-world contexts and further strengthened my interest in pursuing more advanced study in data analysis.

My current academic and professional interests lie in economics, data analysis, and programming. I enjoy exploring how quantitative methods can be used to address real-world economic problems, and I look forward to improving my technical skills while collaborating with classmates who share similar passions.
