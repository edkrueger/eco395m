Hi! I am Zixuan Xu, a first year MS student in ORIE.
I am interested in data analytics with Python.
I had experiences using Python to conduct Machine Learning and data visualization.
But I didn't learn git, SQL, and other very useful tools in real work systematically
Hope to learn more details in this course and make friends with all of you!
