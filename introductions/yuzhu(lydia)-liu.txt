Hello, I'm Yuzhu, you can call me Lydia. I'm currently a second-year student in this program with a background in business. 

Driven by a deep passion for business analytics to create business insights and impact, my career aspiration is to become a trusted leader in this domain, and continue to become a better person and to help others. 

I come with experience in using R, but I'm eager to expand my skills by delving deeper into Python and SQL, which is why I've chosen this course.
