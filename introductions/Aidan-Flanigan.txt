"Hi everyone! I'm Aidan. I've been interested in economics for the better part of a decade now, and while I initially enjoyed more of the political aspects of it at first, I've really come to enjoy the analysis/statistics behind econ. I've been wanting to learn python for quite some time as well, so I'm very excited to take part in this class with everyone!"
