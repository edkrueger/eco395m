Hi, my name is Nicholas (Nick) Jagatnarain! I "enjoy" -or at least find them interesting- certain fields in economics such as industrial organization, competitive stategy, and anything relating to game theory.             
I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Economics from Texas Tech University last December. I enjoy playing basketball, video games, and all kinds of music. I look forward to getting to know y'all!
