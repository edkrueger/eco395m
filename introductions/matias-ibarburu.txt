I graduated from Iowa State University in December 2021 with a double BS in Stats and Econ with a minor in Math. I worked as a data Science analyst at a fintech for close two years. My interest in Econ comes from my interest in why people do what they do. My interest in Stats and data arises from that same question. In a world of billions of people, figuring out what decisions people are making without big data would be impossible. My interest in programming comes from my desire to make things easy and simple to do in the most efficient manner.
