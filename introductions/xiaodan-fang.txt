Hello everyone, my name is Xiaodan (Denis) Fang, a second-year student in this MAE program. I'm mainly interested in 
applied microeconomics field, and I can use Python, Stata and R to achieve my research goals. 
In my spare time I love going to the gym and playing basketball, or just sitting at home to watch TV or play games.
I'm expecting to enhance my programming skills throughout this class, and I'm happy to work projects together with you!
