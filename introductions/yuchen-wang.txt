My name is Yu-Chen Wang from Taiwan and I am in the second year in MA program.
I am interested in macroeconomics, especially monetary policy.
I did not have any experience in my undergrad, so I chose this class to
build up my programming skills to analyze data. I try to learn Spanish but
my tongue can not do the r sound, so I am still working on in time to time.
Nice to meet you!!!
