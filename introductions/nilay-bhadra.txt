Howdy! My name is Nilay Bhadra and I am a second year MA Econ student. I am interested in a variety of applied Microeconomics topics such the political economy, development economics, public policy, etc. I am also interested in using Python techniques/Machine learning models to solve important research oriented tasks. One fun fact about me is that I love dippin dots lol.
