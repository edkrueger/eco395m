Howdy! My name is Kyungsu Noh. Nice to meet you all.
I majored in economics during my undergraduate studies and have worked at the Korea Eximbank for several years. 
My professional experience spans corporate finance, trade finance, and credit analysis and assessment.
In my first team, I supported Official Development Assistance projects in Africa. 
Two years ago, I was dispatched to the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Korea to assist with policy finance initiatives.
Although I have limited experience in programming and data, I am deeply passionate about learning and confident that my enthusiasm will help me grow quickly in these areas.
I am excited to study alongside all of you and look forward to connecting through shared interests and group projects!
