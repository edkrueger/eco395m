Hello, I’m Tiffany. During university, I double majored in Diplomacy and Economics. After graduation, I accumulated five years of experience as a Budget Analyst and Human Resources specialist at Toyota's Taiwan subsidiary. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics at UT Austin. I enjoy combining my expertise in economics with data analysis and programming skills to research and address real-world problems. Additionally, I am proactive and have a passion for strategic thinking. For instance, while at Toyota Taiwan, I managed overall costs, as well as plans and program executions for recruitment and assessment. I leveraged my economics background and problem-solving skills to develop strategies and handle crises in alignment with market conditions and company objectives.
