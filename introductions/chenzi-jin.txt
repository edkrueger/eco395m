Hello everyone, I'm JIN. 

I am fancinated by economics because it uses data and models to make sense of real-world problems, especially market mechanism design.
The greatest appeal of programming is that it helps me tackle complicated practical economic issues effectively. That is why, I am currently developing my skills in Python, R and SQL.
Beyond academics, I am a sports enthusiast. I firmly believe diverse experiences can provide broader perspectives and enhance problem-solving abilities.
Really looking forward to learning with everyone in this class and working together on the cool projects.
