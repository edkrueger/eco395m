Hello everyone, I'm Yi WU. I received my bachelor's degree in Economics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests focus on labor economics, education, and development economics. For programming, I'm proficient in Python and Stata; during my undergraduate years I teamed up with classmates to build a game written entirely in Python.  
I'm a football fan and support Shanghai Shenhua, Aston Villa and Real Madrid.
